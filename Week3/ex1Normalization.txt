1-What columns violate 1NF?
- dinner_date : The attribute has different type of date.
- food_code, food_description: Violation of atomic values

2-What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
- venue_code can be extracted because dinner_id and venue_code refer to same event.
- Member, dinner, venue and food entities could be extracted as different tables.
